# Web-dev-Appointment-Management-System

## Problem
A project supervisor wants an efficient way to manage his/her students and ensure that everyone is given a chance to book an appointment for supervision. 

## Requirements

 1. S/he has constraints of projection supervision days and times which change from semester to semester based on his/her schedule (for example, this semester s/he allows students to come for supervision on Wednesdays (3-6pm) and on Saturdays(3-5pm) and S/he does not want more than three students per day).
 
 2. Our application should have a dash board for the supervisor from which s/he can specify the days and times s/he would be available for supervision during the semester and the maximum number of students s/he can accept for each day

 3. S/he should also be able to view all the appointments booked by the students and send a message to students who have booked appointments.

 4. S/he supervisor can also cancel appointments if need be but must send a message to the affected students.

 5. The application should allow the students to create their profiles and upload their pictures.

 6. After signing in, a student can book an appointment based on the schedule of the supervisor.

 7. The student is allowed to cancel an appointment but this should be done at most 10 hours to the appointment time.

 8. Once the maximum number of appointments per day is attained, the system should no longer allow students to book appointment for that day except someone cancels his/her appointment.
 
 9. While booking appointments, students should also be able to send a message to their supervisor.
